## 1. Problem Statement

### 1a. Revenue Classification (Phases 1–4, DONE)

The funding source creation flow uses AI to extract milestones/terms/covenants from uploaded contracts, but never determines whether the revenue is **Grant Revenue (4100)** or **Earned Income (4300)**. All restricted funding source revenue currently hardcodes to 4100. This needs to be a decision point at fund setup, powered by the AI contract extraction that already exists.

### 1b. Funding Source Taxonomy (Phases 5–8)

Several gaps surfaced during smoke testing:

1. **No funding category dimension.** The system has restriction (RESTRICTED/UNRESTRICTED) and revenue classification (GRANT_REVENUE/EARNED_INCOME) but no way to distinguish grants from contracts from loans. These have different accounting treatments, compliance requirements, and GL routing.

2. **Unrestricted grants aren't first-class citizens.** The creation form gates all detail fields (funder, contract upload, dates, covenants, compliance) behind `restrictionType === 'RESTRICTED'`. An unrestricted operating grant still has a funder, a contract, reporting requirements, and should credit 4100 — but the current UI treats unrestricted as "General Fund, done."

3. **AHP loan is a hardcoded singleton.** The AHP loan is implemented as a separate `ahp_loan_config` table with its own schema, GL logic, UI pages, and reports (~20 files). This should be a regular funding source created through the standard flow.

4. **"Fund" vs "Funding Source" confusion.** The revenue section uses "Funding Sources" consistently but ~30 labels elsewhere say "Fund." Users think in terms of "funding sources" (grants, contracts, loans) not "funds" (GL accounting concept).

---

## 2. Discovery

### Questions (Phases 1–4)

1. Are there any existing restricted funds that should be classified as Earned Income (4300) rather than Grant Revenue (4100)?
2. Should the classification be editable after initial setup, or locked once transactions have posted against the fund?
3. Does the AR invoicing path in `actions.ts` also need revenue account routing, or is it only the two GL functions in `funding-sources.ts`?
4. Should the migration backfill default `GRANT_REVENUE` for all existing restricted funds, or leave them `NULL` and prompt reclassification?
5. For Form 990 purposes — does the classification rationale text need to follow a specific format, or is free-text sufficient?

### Responses (Phases 1–4)

1. **All current restricted funds are grants** — backfill to `GRANT_REVENUE` is correct.
2. **TBD** — suggest: editable until first revenue transaction posts, then read-only with warning.
3. Confirmed: two GL functions (`recordUnconditionalFunding` at line 18, `recognizeConditionalRevenue` at line 169) credit 4100. Cash receipt functions (lines 68, 119) only touch Cash/AR/Refundable Advance — no revenue account, so no change needed.
4. Backfill `GRANT_REVENUE` — all current funds are grants per bookkeeper confirmation.
5. Free-text is fine — the AI generates 2-3 sentences, user can override/append.

### Questions (Phases 5–8)

6. Can grants be unrestricted? → **Yes.** General operating grants, capacity-building grants, unrestricted foundation grants are common. An unrestricted grant still has a funder, may have a contract, and credits 4100 (Grant Revenue).
7. Should "Grant" and "Contract" be collapsed into one category? → **No.** Per Jeff: grants (no direct value returned to funder, ASC 958) and contracts (value exchanged, ASC 606) have different core meanings. Keep separate.
8. Where does the user change interest rates on loans? → **No UI exists.** AHP rate is seeded. `annualRateConfig` table has rate history infrastructure but is AHP-specific and has no user-facing interface.
9. Should loans route through Funding Sources? → **Yes.** Every external financial instrument (grant, contract, loan) enters through Revenue > Funding Sources. Loans differ in GL routing (asset+liability, not revenue).

### Synthesis (Phases 5–8)

Add a `fundingCategory` dimension (GRANT, CONTRACT, LOAN) orthogonal to restriction. Restructure the creation form so all categories get the full treatment (funder, contract upload, covenants, compliance calendar) regardless of restriction. Tear down AHP singleton so it can be recreated as a proper funding source. Standardize UI labels on "Funding Source."

## 3. Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D1 | Add `revenueClassificationEnum` as Postgres enum (`GRANT_REVENUE`, `EARNED_INCOME`) | Matches existing enum pattern in `enums.ts`; DB-level constraint prevents invalid values |
| D2 | Revenue columns nullable — only relevant for GRANT and CONTRACT categories | LOAN sources don't generate revenue; null signals "not applicable" |
| D3 | AI recommends classification, user confirms in same form | No extra step — appears after contract extraction completes, pre-selected with rationale |
| D4 | Store `classificationRationale` as text (not JSON) | Simple audit trail; no structured queries needed on this field |
| D5 | Backfill existing funds with `GRANT_REVENUE` in migration | All current restricted funds are grants per bookkeeper; avoids null-handling edge cases in existing GL logic |
| D6 | Revenue account lookup by classification, not hardcoded | `GRANT_REVENUE` → `4100`, `EARNED_INCOME` → `4300`; both accounts exist in seed data (confirmed) |
| D7 | Manual selection when no contract uploaded | User picks from two radio buttons; no AI recommendation shown |
| D8 | Add `fundingCategoryEnum` (GRANT, CONTRACT, LOAN) — orthogonal to restriction | Grants can be restricted or unrestricted. Contracts are typically restricted. Loans create liability, not revenue. Each has different GL routing and compliance needs |
| D9 | Show funder, contract upload, amount, dates, reporting for ALL categories | Unrestricted grants still have a funder and may have contracts. Decouples rich funding source features from restriction-only gating |
| D10 | Funder required for all funding sources (not just restricted) | Every funding source has a counterparty — funder for grants, contracting party for contracts, lender for loans |
| D11 | Revenue classification auto-defaults from category | GRANT → GRANT_REVENUE, CONTRACT → EARNED_INCOME. AI or user can override. LOAN → null (not revenue) |
| D12 | List page filters to non-system-locked funds | General Fund is the only system-locked fund. It's a default bucket, not a user-created funding source |
| D13 | AHP singleton teardown — remove `ahp_loan_config` and all AHP-specific code | AHP will be recreated as a proper funding source through the standard flow. Keeps account 2500 (AHP Loan Payable) |
| D14 | Standardize UI labels on "Funding Source" | Keep accounting terms (General Fund, Fund Balance, Fund Accounting) unchanged. Update ~30 form labels/column headers across 23 files |

## 9. Session Progress

### Session 1: 2026-02-26 (Discovery + Planning)

**Completed:**
- [x] Created plan document
- [x] Verified current state of all key files
- [x] Confirmed 4100 (Grant Revenue) and 4300 (Earned Income) exist in seed accounts
- [x] Confirmed two GL functions hardcode 4100 (lines 31 and 183 of `funding-sources.ts`)
- [x] Confirmed cash receipt functions don't touch revenue accounts (no change needed)
- [x] Populated design decisions, requirements, and phased implementation plan

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Begin Phase 1: Schema + Migration

### Session 2: 2026-02-27 (Implementation — Phases 1–4)

**Completed:**
- [x] Phase 1: Schema + Migration — enum, columns, validator, seed data, migration, tests (33/33 pass)
- [x] Phase 2: AI Extraction Enhancement — prompt with ASC 958-605/606, types, parser with safe defaults
- [x] Phase 3: UI + Server Action — RadioGroup classification UI, server action persistence, detail page display
- [x] Phase 4: Revenue GL Logic — helper function, 3 GL functions updated (recordUnconditionalFunding, recognizeConditionalRevenue, createArInvoice)
- [x] Fixed PO form TypeScript error from updated ContractExtractionData interface
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors
- [x] Schema tests: 33/33 pass
- [x] Restricted fund release tests: 10/10 pass

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Run migration on staging: `drizzle/0016_revenue_classification.sql`
- [ ] Smoke test: create new funding source with contract upload, verify AI classification

### Session 3: 2026-02-27 (Phases 5–6 — Funding Category + AHP Teardown)

**Completed:**
- [x] Full codebase audit of AHP footprint (~20 files across schema, GL, UI, reports, tests)
- [x] Assessed terminology standardization viability (23 files, ~30 labels — low risk)
- [x] Confirmed unrestricted grants need first-class support
- [x] Confirmed loans-as-funding-sources approach (future Phase 8)
- [x] Confirmed interest rate infrastructure exists in `annualRateConfig` (AHP-only, no UI)
- [x] Updated plan with Phases 5–8

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Begin Phase 5: Funding Category + Form Restructure

### Session 4: 2026-02-27 (Phase 5 — Funding Category + Form Restructure)

**Completed:**
- [x] Phase 5 full implementation — all 16 tasks
- [x] `fundingCategoryEnum` (GRANT, CONTRACT, LOAN) + column + migration with backfill
- [x] Validator: `fundingCategory` required, `funderId` required for all categories
- [x] Form restructure: category selector, auto-default revenue classification, LOAN hides classification
- [x] Form labels: "Lender" for LOAN, "Principal Amount" for LOAN, detail fields gated by category not restriction
- [x] AI extraction: prompt + types + parser now recommend category
- [x] List page: category badges (purple=GRANT, blue=CONTRACT, orange=LOAN), fixed status display
- [x] Detail page: category badge, ungated sections from restriction-only to category-based
- [x] **Unrestricted fund GL posting rule** (user directive): 7 fund selectors updated to filter `WHERE isActive AND (isSystemLocked OR restrictionType = 'RESTRICTED')` — unrestricted funding sources exist for tracking, not GL posting
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors
- [x] Schema tests: 35/35 pass

**Design rule established:** Unrestricted funding sources (grants, loans) are first-class objects for contract tracking, covenants, compliance, and reporting — but all unrestricted GL posting goes through General Fund. Only restricted funds appear in expense/GL fund selectors.

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Run migration on staging: `drizzle/0017_funding_category.sql`
- [x] Smoke test: create new funding source with category selector
- [x] Begin Phase 6: AHP Singleton Teardown

### Session 5: 2026-02-27 (Phase 6 — AHP Singleton Teardown)

**Completed:**
- [x] Phase 6 full implementation — all 20 tasks
- [x] Deleted ~20 AHP-specific files (schema, seed, GL logic, UI pages, reports)
- [x] Removed AHP imports/actions from revenue actions.ts
- [x] Cleaned up references in cash-position.ts, help terms, copilot contexts, validators, tests
- [x] Removed AHP-specific interest accrual logic (generic accrual preserved)
- [x] Removed AHP entries from GL-only categories
- [x] Migration: `DROP TABLE ahp_loan_config` (account 2500 kept)
- [x] Updated copilot knowledge files
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors
- [x] All existing tests pass

### Session 6: 2026-02-27 (Phase 7 — UI Terminology)

**Completed:**
- [x] Phase 7 full implementation — 28 files updated
- [x] "Fund" → "Funding Source" across transaction, expense, PO, ramp, revenue, budget, prepaid, report, vendor, and staging forms
- [x] Added "funding-source" glossary entry to help terms
- [x] Updated copilot contexts for terminology consistency
- [x] Preserved correct accounting terms: General Fund, Fund Balance, Fund Accounting, Fund Allocation, Fund-Level P&L

### Session 7: 2026-02-28 (Phase 8 — Loan GL + Interest Rates + Amortization Report)

**Completed:**
- [x] Phase 8 full implementation — all 18 tasks
- [x] 3 new GL functions: `recordLoanProceeds`, `recordLoanRepayment`, `recordLoanInterestPayment`
- [x] GL routing: Cash↔Loan Payable (2500) for proceeds/repayment, Interest Expense (5100) for interest
- [x] New `funding_source_rate_history` table with migration (`0020_funding_source_rate_history.sql`)
- [x] Rate change modal on funding source detail page
- [x] Rate history timeline on detail page
- [x] Loan operations UI: 3-card grid (proceeds, repayment, interest) on detail page
- [x] `getEffectiveRate()` — fund-specific rate lookup from history table
- [x] Auto-seed initial rate history entry on loan creation
- [x] Auto-record loan proceeds GL on creation
- [x] Amortization Schedule report: `/reports/amortization-schedule` with loan selector
- [x] API route: `/api/reports/amortization-schedule?fundId=`
- [x] Added to REPORT_DEFINITIONS (28 available reports total)
- [x] 4 new validators: `loanProceedsSchema`, `loanRepaymentSchema`, `loanInterestPaymentSchema`, `loanRateChangeSchema`
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors
- [x] Schema tests: 35/35 pass
- [x] Report tests: 36/36 pass

**Status:** All 8 phases complete. Revenue Classification & Funding Source Taxonomy plan is DONE.
